<h2>Pallet Lift Truck Falmouth</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>

<p>The cost to rent a narrow aisle forklift is roughly $200 to $300 per day, $400 to $500 per week, and $1,000 to $1,500 per month. These machines can also navigate fields, pastures, pens, and loading areas. The largest of the "core" line of cushion trucks, the 15,500 lb. truck has the largest counterweight and the largest lifting capacity. Because of the additional weight from larger tires on your lifted truck, frequent oil changes are recommended when you lift your truck or SUV.</p>
