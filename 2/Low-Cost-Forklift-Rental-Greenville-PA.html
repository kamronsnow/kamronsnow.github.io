<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support.

<p>Non-serious injuries related to forklift accidents reach 61,800 each year in the USA. In my region, paper mills call them tow motors,” warehouses may refer to them as stackers,” and builders tend to use telehandlers” in lieu of rough terrain forklifts.” OSHA uses the all-encompassing phrase powered industrial trucks,” or PITs, when referring to forklifts in its 1910.178 standard.</p>

In 1962, the first telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift came on the market.

Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>
