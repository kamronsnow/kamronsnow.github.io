<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. We offer a range of financing options for companies who need a forklift now. In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013. If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>
<p>Our versatile Furniture Orderpickers enable you to equip your truck with the ideal fork length with extended baselegs for rail guidance application; select from varying fork lengths ranging from 42-96 inches. Generally, the forklift's wheels and frame are designed for a specific tire type, so check the forklift's manual before going with a different tire type than what is recommended.</p>

<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components. Where typical fork lift trucks need to approach a load head on, on a flat even surface, an all-terrain or rough terrain forklift can pick up a load even when the load is on a slope or otherwise unusually positioned.</p>

Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>
<p>3-wheel forklifts are typically more maneuverable than 4-wheel machines. Your crew can easily drive these machines through small openings and use them in tight workspaces. As a result, customers can get the best possible lift kit installation process. The Cat Lift Trucks Scholarship Program has awarded more than $130,000 in educational assistance to Houston-area students.</p>
<p>The majority of fatalities stem from forklift turnovers, so an obvious advantage of pushing a cart as opposed to sitting in a vehicle is not going down with the ship, so to speak, if it slips off a loading dock or tips due to an unbalanced load.

In the UK, there are six approved training companies: Association of Industrial Truck Trainers (AITT), Independent Training Standards Scheme and Register (ITSSR), Lantra Awards , National Plant Operators Registration Scheme , Road Transport Industry Training Board (RTITB), Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).</p>
