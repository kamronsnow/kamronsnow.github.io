<p>Equipment Solutions for Your Short and Long-term Rental Needs. Counterbalance forklift trucks are versatile and can be operated both indoors and outdoors. H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years. MARCOM's Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks training has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
<p>Forklift types vary in several aspects, from their fuel type and tire composition to their lift capacity and height. You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road. Riding on unfathomable volumes of industrial expertise, we are offering an extensive range of High Lift Pallet Truck.</p>
<h2>Material Handling Tools To Lift You Up in North Platte </h2>
<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The forklift's center of gravity moves when you accelerate, brake, or turn. With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>
<p>Driving a couple of inches higher will not only offer you a much better view of the road, but your vehicle's body and lower parts will also be considerably safer from flood water and street debris. Forklifts range in size depending on their function. A forklift is a mobile machine that uses two prongs, or forks, to lift and place loads into positions which are ordinarily difficult to reach.</p>
<p>This powered industrial truck contains twin forks extending in the front and is used to carry heavy loads. We have specialized in new and used forklift sales in Surrey, Vancouver and surrounding areas for over 41 years. Suitable for indoor horizontal transportation and stacking, such as in warehouses, distribution centers and logistics companies, the Toyota range of powerful reach trucks offers high acceleration and exceptional drivability for optimum pallet movement.</p>

Designed for light, medium and heavy-duty material handling, our internal combustion (IC) counterbalanced trucks are equipped with the unique Toyota System of Active Stability (Toyota SAS) to enhance operator safety and comfort.</p>
<p>But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site. Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
