Manual pallet jacks have existed since at least 1918. Heavy loads and the shifting center-of-gravity can tip a forklift over if it goes too fast. For intricate indoor operations, reach forklift trucks can provide drivers with another set of eyes when they are handling a robust inventory.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
