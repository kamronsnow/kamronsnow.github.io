Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.</p>

<p>Supporting a forklift platform is operated on a firm flat surface. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast.

<p>The 12,000 lb. electric is built on a larger frame than the 8,000 to 10,000 lb. trucks.

The higher ground clearance will help your truck handle different types of road conditions.
