<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
