Growing industrialization is anticipated to drive the demand for pallet trucks, especially from non-traditional industries in growing economies in Asia Pacific.

The reach forklift is capable of performing the same types of work as the counterbalance and can be fitted with attachments for special lifting jobs as required. When a 15,500 lb. forklift isn't enough, you'll need a high-capacity cushion forklift to get the job done.</p>
<p>Considered the most common type of forklift truck overall, counterbalanced models are designed with a weight that's built into the rear of the truck's body. Ausa T204H: This fork truck rental falls under the telehandler category, as it combines the lifting capacity of a forklift with the reach of a crane.

<h2>Used Material Handling Equipment Little Chute</h2>

Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>
