The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely.

<h2>Side Lift Truck Budd Lake</h2>

If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>
