In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>
<p>Easily movable sidegates allow operators to open the case-picking window, helping them to be more productive. Battery and charger included with rentals. If alternate capacities are shown for elevations lower than maximum, alternate capacities not shown may be 2 assumed to fall on a straight line between the capacity and the alternate capacities shown for each load center.</p>
