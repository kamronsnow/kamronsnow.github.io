<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. These types of forklifts can accelerate and travel at higher speeds, which also makes them ideal for outdoor uses. More elaborate lift kits not only raise the body of your truck up but can also increase the clearance of your truck's frame and let you put bigger tires on your pickup. Take a closer look at the most important features to find out how rough terrain forklifts get the job done.</p>
<p>At Frank Kent CDJR, we have used lifted trucks for sale, and our expert service staff can install lift kits into one of our new or used pickups for you.

Simply click on the forklift make and model you are interested in for pricing.</p>
<p>Motorized hand trucks must enter elevator or other confined areas with load end forward. There is a structure of movable parts which enable proper operating of the forklifts. The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily. The Hummer seems to be able to age well no matter how old it gets; and it also somehow avoids the Tonka toy look that sometimes befouls trucks when you try to put tires too large on them.</p>
<h2>Hand Lift Truck Crowley</h2>
<p>If your company has an old forklift on its way out, get in touch.
