Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks.

<p>United Rentals is an Authorized Dealer for Motorola and can provide a variety of handheld and portable radio solutions. These manual pallet jacks are ideal for special applications.
