In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period.

The Toyota Order Picker easily maneuvers narrow aisles in warehouses with minimized rack impact during case picking thanks to optional wire guidance and double rail guidance systems.
