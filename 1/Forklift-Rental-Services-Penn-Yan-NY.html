<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>The cost of renting a bucket truck will depend on the truck you're driving, the company, the working height, the geographical location and time you need it. The largest pricing factor, most of the time, will be the height limit. Most of the shipping firms now carry truck-mounted forklifts with them to easily off-load the construction products.
