The term "rough terrain forklift" is a somewhat broad name that often encompasses a number of different machines. LiftKing - if you use rough terrain forklifts on the job, there's a good chance you've come across more than a few LiftKing models.</p>
<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
<p>Wang says that Hangcha will continue to invest in rough-terrain R&D, particularly in developing equipment with more tonnage and configurations. Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. They have been renting out equipment for over 50 years.</p>
