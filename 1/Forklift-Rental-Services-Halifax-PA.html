If you need to rent a forklift in Virginia , South Carolina , or North Carolina , look no further than Gregory Poole, your trusted source of material handling equipment and warehousing solutions.

<h2>Roll Lifting & Material Handling Equipment Halifax </h2>
<p>We manufacture, export, import and supply a wide range of equipment for Floor Transportation comprising of Electric Pallet Trucks, Scissor Hand Pallet Trucks, Hydraulic Hand Pallet Trucks and Electric Platform Trucks. Load Backrest Extension should have height, width, and size of openings (not to exceed 6 inches in one of the two dimensions) sufficient to minimize the possibility of the load from falling toward the mast when the mast is in a position of maximum rearward tilt.</p>

<h2>Reach Fork Truck Halifax</h2>
<p>They offer straightforward operation and have dual forks at the front of the truck that lift and transport the loads. Raymond offers a full line of durable pallet trucks for sale and pallet jack rentals to meet your delivery, order picking, and horizontal transport needs. The maximum allowable load should be clearly marked on the nameplate of the forklift truck.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>This type of mast is common in rental fleets and just about anywhere else that uses forklifts. The following are examples of Class VI powered industrial trucks. Whether you need a small or large model for a day, a week, or a month, BigRentz has the rough terrain forklift your crew needs.

<p>The M-series reach trucks have a narrow chassis design and 360° steering, this makes them ideal for material operations like block stacking, drive-in racking and other confined areas.
