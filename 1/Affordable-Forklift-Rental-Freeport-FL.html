<p>For off road purposes, lifting a truck is the best way to improve its performance. In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period. In the past this job was done with either ladders, a dangerous and ineffective solution, or with reach trucks with goods on pallets and blocked aisles.

However, lifting provides many advantages for off-road use, including greater approach, breakover, and departure angles.
