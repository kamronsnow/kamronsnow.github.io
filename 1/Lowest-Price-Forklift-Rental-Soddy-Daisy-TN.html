That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>

<p>What you need to do: Take a practical test where the forklift is driven around a suitable course and the operator will be required to move and stack various loads, the test will also include one to one verbal questioning. Able to lift up to 8 t, these forklifts are rugged and suited for outdoor applications.
