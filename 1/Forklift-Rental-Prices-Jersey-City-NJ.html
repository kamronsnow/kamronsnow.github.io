Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>

Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.

Always start the engine while seated in the operator's position—never while standing alongside the forklift.</p>
<p>Whether it's for a short-term job, a seasonal spike in business, or you're a small operation with limited resources; renting can be a perfect solution for you.
